Wherever you find yourself shipwrecked you build a temporary home out of leaves and sticks.  You use hollowed out coconuts for lemonade glasses or to make string bikinis you will never ever wear.  You use sand and water.  You make mud for no reason.  Whatever’s lying around, you use it.  But the trick is you build everything so flimsy that it has to fall apart.  And when it does it looks like an accident, like unfortunate circumstances, or bad luck or timing.  And that’s your way out.  Then you go get shipwrecked somewhere else and start building again.

Hope you guys enjoy it!</em></p><p>Woo! I made it to the most actice authors list! Thanks commenting :) Check out the people who really deserve to be on the list here…<br><strong>http://ficlets.com/authors</strong></p><p>Hello everyone! I like to write. I guess that’s why I’m here on the ever wonderful Ficlets. Writing really is the best way to deal with all those bottled up feelings. Ficlets is the best place to do that because really no one knows what they heck you’re talking about and isn’t going to go around school spilling all your secrets. I also love the way that you can just publish random segments of a story that might pop into your head and see where they can go.</p><p>Comments, notes, prequels/sequesl are all greatly appreciated. I love signing on and seeing I’ve got a new comment or a new note. It just makes me SO happy :)</p><p>School’s started! Very exciting stuff happening now but lots of work. Feels good to be back and seeing all my people again.</p><p>A little about myself, I’m now a senior in high school (excited and scared out of my mind), I have 3 siblings all younger. I have 3 cats and a fish who absolutely refuses to die (he’s going to be 5 this summer). I think he’s a hitman for the mob the cats run in our neighborhood. Most (but not all) of my Ficlets are some how tied to the same guy (it gets obvious after a while). Really helps to move on when you just write about all the frustrations :) Now most of my ficlets will probably be about a new guy. Lol, I’m a teenage girl. What else am I going to write about :P</p><p>I’m the executive secretary of the band at my school. I play alto sax and bass clarinet. I used to play alto clarinet but our new director didn’t want to use it this year :( I can be REALLY random sometimes and I think I may be a bit crazy (at least that’s what everyone tells me. I’m not sure though).</p><p>Note to everyone; if a crazy old lady tries to be the president of any type of booster association for any activity make sure that she isn’t. She will ruin EVERYTHING. Just in case it ever happens to any one else.</p><p>If I post a comment multiple times I’m saying sorry in advanced. My computer is ridiculously slow sometimes and forces me to press the button 5 million times. If not it comes to life and eats the closest thing made of rubber. Or is it plastic? Anyways I’m very sorry for the random comments that may or may not be posted several times.</p><p>6/4/07 – 300 Comments (Still only 30 Ficlets)<br>6/24/07 – 400 Comments (I made it to 45 Ficlets woo hoo!)<br>6/30/08 – 500 comments (almost 80 Ficlets)<br>7/6/08 – 700 comments (where did 600 go? lol)<br>8/13/08 – 800 comments (so close to 100 Ficlets)<br>9/14/08 – 900 comments (still really close to 100 Ficlets) <br><strong>9/20/08 – 100 Ficlets (YAY!!!!!)</strong><br>9/26/08 – 1000 comments (woo! commenting-holic!)<br>11/9/08 – 1100 comments (so many random comments that probably make no sense, woo!)<br>11/18/08 – 1200 comments (this rocks!)<br>11/21/08 – 1300 comments (yes I stayed home commenting rather than go see Twilight)<br>11/23/08 – 1400 comments (and still only 136 ficlets.

I do weather observations for a living, but my real dream is to become a published author.<br>.<br>18/03/08: I may be more prepared for National Novel Writer’s Month (NaNoWriMo) than I thought. The challenge with NaNoWriMo is to write a 50,000 word novel in 1 month. It works out to an average of 1,612 words a day. In about 10 hours (plus 2 more for <em>Knight Rider</em> breaks), I punched out 29 ficlets totalling  5,250 words.<br>.<br>Oh, yeah! Bring it on!<br>.<br>Damn… It’s only March…<br>.<br>13/03/08: I have now joined the ranks of the League of Awesomeness. Now, I must think of an appropriate title. How does Geekus Awesomeus sound? Yes, I like that. :D<br>.<br>Okay, I think there are enough people reading (and enjoying! WOO-HOO!) my stories that I should expand on this. Let you know a little more about me.<br>.<br>Um…<br>.<br>Well…<br>.<br>Gods, I hate talking about myself. How do you describe yourself without sounding either a) self-centered or b) overly critical? Ah, well. C’est la vie. :D<br>.<br>Well, let’s start with this: My sister taught me how to read when I was 3, and I was reading (and understanding) <em>National Geographic</em> by age 4. Is it any wonder she became a teacher? That got me interested in reading, but what got my hooked on writing stories was my introduction to role-playing games (ie Dungeons & Dragons – see http://ficlets.com/stories/23405 for more on that).<br>.<br>I was always writing in high school, but I never showed anyone my stories, outside of teachers, of course. And that was just because it was needed for grading. I enjoyed writing, but I never thought I was good enough for people to actually read what I wrote. And so, after high school, I stopped writing (other than character backgrounds for RPG’s) for almost 2 decades.<br>.<br>Then, two things happened. First, I had a bit of a breakdown one night. Stress. And I didn’t know where to direct it for relief. My fiancee, gods love her, suggested I start writing again. I told her I didn’t think I was good enough, and she (in not so many words) told me I was being an idiot.<br>.<br>The second thing that happened was stumbling across Wil Wheaton’s blog. I knew Wil (like 90% of the known universe) from <em>Star Trek: TNG</em> and <em>Stand By Me</em>, and I started reading his blog, which I’d heard was good. It’s beyond good. It’s fabulous! He’s smart, funny, and insightful, and just a damned good author. I got his audiobook <em>Just A Geek</em> and his book <em>The Happiest Days Of Our Lives</em>, and just something about these books really inspired me to get my writing back on track.<br>.<br>And it’s through Wil’s blog that I came across that font of awesomeness that is Ficlets. So, to make a long story short (not that this is exactly short), <strong>this is all your fault, Wheaton!</strong> Thank you. Thank you so much!<br>.<br>Anyhoo, if you want to know anything more about me, drop me a line.

After years living lower than the dredges of society, I found a book and learned to read, and write. I scrounged for pencils and wrote wherever I could. I wrote about my life, and how I thought. Eventually a poet/hobo befriended me and helped me to get a publishing deal. It changed my life. Since then, I’ve worked my way up to become a Nobel Prize laureate and a hope for millions.

God is my best friend and I look for Him everywhere and I find Him in everyone.<br>Please don’t take my writings too personally.  I spend alot of time alone and in the word of God.  Like many of the other people of the word, I have had some battles in this life.  As a matter of fact anytime you fight evil with good you will have a battle.  The good thing is that God fights all my battles and I usually just have to struggle with the fear.  Out of the fear sometimes I spew my feelings in these little ficlets.  Because of the nature of my other online books they are formatted in a different way.  Here I have much more liberty to just vent a scripture that goes hand in hand with a lightening bolt like Psalms 18..”He sends forth His lightening bolts and routs His enemies.”  The good thing, the very good thing, is that I have no idea who my enemies are.  So, I can be free to love or at least try to love everyone.  I have suffered unspeakable loss in this life time and some of my writings will have evidences of pain in them. Thank you for understanding.  I think someone once said, love and hate are very similar.  And if you can do one in a great measure than you can do the other.

Although much of the focus concerning writing in educational institutions is on how to write correctly, the skill of writing with style and entertaining the reader must be developed with discipline and practice.  It is helpful to be familiar with the stages of the writing process:  Prewriting, Writing, Editing, Revising, and Publishing.  The prewriting stage starts with an idea or inspiration and involves research and planning.  Freewriting is a common prewriting technique used by writers to explore and form ideas—it is recommended that serious writers devote about ten minutes a day to freewriting.</p><p>The writing stage (also known as the drafting stage) produces a rough draft.  As with the prewriting stage, it is important that the writer not focus on perfection while forming a rough draft.  This can create serious problems such as writer’s block.  It is not necessary for the writer to use proper grammar or spelling, or even put paragraphs in order.</p><p>In the editing stage, the writer reads the rough draft and decides what will stay or go.  It is often wise to enlist peers to review the work and add their input.  The editing stage leads right into the revision stage, where the rough draft is rewritten to include the changes, and the publishing stage, where the work is polished and prepared to be turned in to a teacher or publisher.</p><p>Whether you are writing for school or professionally, utilizing the writing process will help you practice and fine tune your writing ability.  Writing is difficult, but with guidance and discipline, just about anyone can do it.  Start with a blank piece of paper and a sharp pencil, and go from there.</p>','2009-01-12 02:34:28','2014-09-12 22:00:30'),

Loyalty to your country, or loyalty to me? Your country,or your mentor? Your mission, or your beliefs? Your duty to your unit? Or your personal feelings? You don’t know the truth yet. But sooner or later, you’ll have to choose. I don’t expect you to forgive me. But you can’t defeat me, either. You know me too well. If you can’t put the past behind you, you won’t survive long. If we meet again, I’ll kill you.</p><p>Life’s end…Isn’t it beautiful? It’s almost tragic. When life ends, it gives off a final lingering aroma. Light is but a farewell gift from the darkness to those on their way to die. I’ve been waiting,for a long time.Waiting for your birth, your growth,and the finality of today.</p><p>So why am I doing this? To make the world one again. The world used to be whole. But with the end of the Second World War, the people of the world began to fight amongst  themselves and the world was torn apart. I was torn apart as well. The foibles of politics and the march of time can turn friends into enemies just as easily as the wind changes. Ridiculous, isn’t it? Yesterday’s ally becomes today’s opposition. And the Cold War? Think back…America and Russia were fighting together. Now consider whether America and Russia will still be enemies future. Somehow, I doubt it. Enemies change along with the times, and the flow of the ages. And we soldiers are forced to play along.I didn’t raise you and shape you into the person you are today just so we could face each other in battle. A soldier’s skills aren’t meant to be used to hurt friends. So then what is an enemy? Is there such thing as an  absolute timeless enemy? There is no such thing and never has been. And the reason is that our enemies are human beings like us. They can only be our enemies in relative terms. The world must be made whole again. I will devote my skills to that purpose.I will achieve that end!</p><p>There is nothing left inside me now. Nothing at all. No hatred, not even regret.

Writing stories is something that I enjoy a lot, but I hate writing essays too. There too formal for me. Got one book done already that’s….13 chapters long? And I’m working on another one my “editors” say is really good and when I stop writing it they send me hate mail.</p><p>What else to say?....I love music sooo music. I listen to it nonstop while I write and it calms me so much. As for the genre of music….I listen to all genres except for rap and hip hop. I also play flute and viola(which is bigger than a violin for all who don’t know).</p><p>Writing is my main pastime, making me sound like I have no life. Which is pretty much the case. School is boring, except for Wellness class. That’s pretty interesting, learning about drugs. XD</p><p>My writing style you ask? Don’t ask why (cuz I don’t know the answer) but I love writing about those topics that are total taboo in real life. My mindset is, <em>Well no one writes about that, so I’m going to be different and write about it,</em> and then I go for it. And my fav POV is totally first person. I mean, you really get into the character’s heads that way. And I’m sorry to everyone who is angered by how descriptive I can be, saying it isn’t right for ficlets. I like descriptions unlike those losers. Descriptions make things so much more intense.</p><p>Oh, I have a hamster named Hermes. The ficlet luck and the hamster Alec in Sangsue are based off of this little guy. Poor Hermes is unfortunetly schizophrenic, but he’s still uber adorable.</p><p>And now I think of what else to add on…..I’m sure more will be on the way.</p><p>I’ve got a bunch of mini stories on here. From what I hear they’re quite poetic. But I don’t know.</p><p>And about the topic of comments.

Some of my friends have described me as “intense.” In context of the prior metaphor, the hamster never stops running: I don’t turn off. As a burgeoning philosopher of Information Technology, I have a number of interests: Information Technology (Databases and Human-Computer Interaction, specifically), Philosophy, and Communications comprise my primary academic specialties. For relaxation, I tend to spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer or reading. My primary social activities tend to be pencil and paper based Role-Playing games, though I also tend to have random abstract conversations about a topic du jour. As a notable recent example, my friends and I discussed the implications of sociopathy in small group interactions in high risk environments. Other topics include discussions of various philosophies and current events of interest.</p><p>I recently completed my Master’s Degree and will be starting my Ph.D. in the philosophy of Information Technology in a few weeks. I’m also deriving great satisfaction and validation from teaching as an adjunct professor for my department. My future plans revolve around completing the Ph.D. and teaching at any college that would take a professor of my interests. In terms of favorite literary works, they change with the seasons. However, the authors I find myself returning to and those most influential on my mental processes are the following: Terry Pratchett, Neal Stephenson, David Drake, Robert Heinlein, Jerry Pournelle, and Keith Laumer.</p>','2009-01-12 03:17:52','2014-09-12 22:00:32'),

It offers escape and freedom and anything you ask of it.</p><p>Why I love writing…well let’s see. You have the power to create a new world. You can create new animals or places or even words. You have the power to give birth to the imaginary friends inside your head and then kill them…with one stroke of your pen. You can create your perfect world. There is so much power behind the pen…all you really need is an overactive imagination, a little flair, and a dictionary to open up worlds never explored before.

If it is from an experience, I would usually try to change the plot and make it so it would have a somewhat feeling of what it was like back then.</p><p>Most of the things I write, will turn out differently. Like, when I make series, I would think it’s good at first, but then I don’t know what to write so I kind of think of something and sometimes it just ruins it. I try to avoid it though. But when I make a short story (Like 1 or 2 ficlets), they actually turn out well. At least that’s what I think. Might be different for you guys.</p><p>Currently have like 2 or 3 series. Thinking about stopping them since they aren’t turning out as great as I thought they would be. The one about Ryan going to school, yeah, not from real experience. Just thought I should write about something like that. It was longer than I thought it was going to be.</p><p>Anyways, I like to hang out with friends, meeting new people, listening to music, play the viola, and like to express myself through writing most of the time. But most of the time, I don’t come up with something to write when I want to. It usually just pops up randomly, even when I’m at school.</p><p>When I grow up, I want to be a game animator. Reason, is that I get to create the characters and the background of games. It seems fun and creative. Either that, or just an animator for random stuff. Maybe creating my own stories in the future. Maybe part story writer. Who knows.</p><p>So yeah. I hope you enjoy reading my ficlets.</p>','2009-01-12 03:31:09','2014-09-12 22:00:32'),

I have an usual fascination for other cultures than my own, I hope to take up Bharatanatyam, a traditional Hindi dance, or possibly belly-dancing. I hope to more fully understand the cultures and concepts of Hinduism and Buddhism, as I already have done some research on them, but I was brought up as Roman Catholic, and am quickly approaching my confirmation. This, to me, is a very tedious subject for several reasons:<br>A. I started my Christian education a little late, so I have no idea how Confirmation is supposed to work<br>B. Too much pressure on my half- Do I really accept Catholic beliefs? Does this force me to stay Catholic forever?<br>C. Does God frown upon me for the questions mentioned above?<br>So, you can hopefully see why this concerns me so much. Anyway, if I could just leave my house and travel the world at my age, I would.

The story alternates between the present, where the lead character, Cooper, is suicidal and distraught about something he did “that night” and the past, which tells the story about “that night.”</p><p><strong>The Pillar</strong>(http://ficlets.com/stories/29796) is a look a space-faring human race who haven’t found any aliens and fallen to complacency, then are confronted with a new enemy.</p><p><strong>Out-of-Order Challenge</strong><br>(http://ficlets.com/stories/31553) is a response to a posted challenge to write a Pulp-Fiction style story, where the events are told…you guessed it…out of order.  I’ve wrapped this one up.</p><p><strong>You must check this out.</strong>  The best story going on Ficlets is by JLaughter.  It’s called Bagman, starting with <strong>http://ficlets.com/stories/30471</strong>.  If you like the Neuromancer, Johny Nmonic, Cyberpunk world, then this is two slices of awesome wrapped in bacon.</p><p>I’m very flattered by any comments, prequels, or sequels to my writing.

The person who goes first is the person on the outside ring. <br>     Each turn, the player roles the dice. If the dice lands on the numbers 4 – 6 then he or she must re-roll. For whatever amount the dice lands on, that player jumps ahead that many spaces to the right.<br>     When a player reaches a corner, (The spaces with numbers in them.) that player may not pass it or land on it until he or she has money equal to the number provided. <br>Example: <br>If the player rolls a 3 when his or her character is at the square directly to the left of the corner, then the player may not go forward that many spaces unless he or she has that much money.<br>     Corners count as spaces when you move.</code></pre><p>Characters and Money</p><pre><code>All players choose one of the four playable characters. No two players can be the same character.</code></pre><pre><code>The first character is the Plantation Owner: He starts out at the outer most ring. At the beginning of the characters owner’s turn, this player gets one extra slave. Once each turn, the Plantation Owner gets $300 for each slave he has.</code></pre><pre><code>The second character is the Slave Trader: This player starts out by rolling a dice to move like every other player, but after he moves, he gets to roll another dice. If it is a 4 – 6 then he gets one slave. (All players keep their slaves on the paper they have to keep things from getting confusing.) He does not get money for having slaves, but instead he may sell them at whatever price he wants to the plantation owner, but the minimum price for selling them is - $400. This character’s ring is the one in the middle towards the outside.</code></pre><pre><code>The third character is the Slave Hunter: He does not get a cumulative upkeep like the Plantation Owner does, but instead gets money for catching escaped slaves. When the Slave Conductor helps a slave escape, the Slave Hunter may roll a dice for each slave the Conductor helps escape. If he rolls a 5 – 6 then he automatically gets control of the slave he rolled for. He may offer to sell as many individual slaves to the Plantation Owner for a minumum price of 700 dollars each. If the Plantation Owner refuses to buy them then the Slave Hunter may one time only get 25 dollars for that slave. This character’s ring is the middle one towards the center.</code></pre><pre><code>The fourth character is the Slave Conductor: At the beginning of this character’s turn, he or she rolls a dice. Whatever the number is, that player has the option of helping that many slaves escape. The Slave Conductor can once turn help a slave escape that the Plantation Owner controls. <br>Example:<br>The Slave Conductor rolls a 5 when he moves. He gets to move 5 spaces but comes to a corner and does not have the reasonable money to pass it. The player stops at the space directly before the corner. Then he or she rolls a dice to see how many slaves escape. The player rolls a 5! He decides to help all of the slaves escape PLUS the one extra slave the Plantation Owner controls. He gets 300 dollars. The Slave Hunter then rolls a dice for each slave the player helped escape. He managed to get a 3, 2, 5, 1, 2 and a 6. He gets two slaves, and the Slave Conductor gets an additional 200 dollars.<br>     The Slave Hunter now has 2 slaves that he can sell. The Slave Conductor now has 500 dollars, and the Plantation Owner has lost a slave.<br>     Each turn he may get $50 for each slave he decides to help escape. Then, the Slave Hunter rolls a dice to see if he gets any of them. (If he does get the slave the Slave Conductor still retains the earlier $50.) For each slave the Slave Hunter does not get, the Slave Conductor gets another $50.<br>     This character’s ring is the centermost one.</code></pre><p>Rewards and Risk Cards</p><pre><code>In the middle of each two corners are * marked spaces. When a player lands on one, then he draws a risk card, and then does what the effect of the card says. If a risk card says “Go to jail.? Then that player may not move his or her piece to roll for the next turn and does not get any money for that turn, but may still only buy slaves. If your character can only sell slaves help them run away, or catch them, then you may not buy slaves because that counts as getting money.</code></pre><pre><code>When a plays lands on a corner or passes one, then he or she draws a reward card, and then does whatever the effect of the card says.</code></pre><p>How to Win</p><p>A players win by getting to the final corner of their ring.

If you ignored the sarcasm, dry wit, random telling of dirty jokes, that is.  This young girl slowly grew into a young woman.  She surrounded herself by those that wouldn’t get all weepy if she told them it wasn’t the pants that made their butts look big.  That sometimes objects in the mirror were actually as large as they appeared.  That some people liked big butts and cannot lie.  People learned to come to her if they wanted the truth because that was the first thing that came from her lips.</p><p>She had a broken circuit in her brain it seemed.  Where normal people would filter their words, hers just slipped right through.  She was often dismayed by the reactions.  “If you didn’t want to know you shouldn’t have asked.” became her mantra.  Pretty soon she decided that it was best to just keep her mouth shut.  So, she took a vow of silence.</p><p>Now, she is working on trying to convince her fingers that the vow of silence includes them.  They are in an extreme battle of wills at this time.

	(1638,'Asreisea','frozen_roses','<p>Asreisea is a 22 year old English and Creative Writing student from Manchester, England. She has an obsessive personality, and as such, anything she gets into, she becomes obsessed with. Roleplaying and Realms of Alala are no different. Currently, she should be reading her assigned booklist for next semester, but finds Melanie Rawn far more thrilling.</p><p>She is a major fantasy writer and has huge ideas for stories. Sadly she’s a little lazy and many of those do not come to fruition. She enjoys the complexity in creating new worlds and peoples and cultures. When she closes her eyes, worlds spring at her, and she catches some of them, whirling the ideas for stories in her mind and writing those ideas down. Maybe one day, she’ll come back to them and actually write them. Who knows. Her fantasy can be found on fictionpress.com under the same pen name.</p><p>She is keen on fanfiction, and writes that on various sites under the same pen name, and is completely obsessed by fanfic as well. If she doesn’t update here, it’s because she’s been writing fic and needs a slap of someone.</p><p>Usually good tempered, she doesn’t mind speaking to anyone and loves creative criticism on all aspects of her work. She only asks you to take in mind that her grammar and spelling is awful and not complain about that until she has found a beta reader.</p><p>Her favourite things to do is read and write, and play Realms of Alala. In her spare time, she does her university work. She has other hobbies, which include, and are not limited to tormenting and teasing her friends, going to the cinema to see lots of different types of films (though pretending a horror really isn’t a horror and convincing scared friends to go with her is a big delight to her), listening to music (for which she has a very eclectic taste, ranging from Enya, to Nightwish, from Meatloaf to Sarah McLachlan) and playing on her shiny (and pink!) Nintendo DS.</p>','2009-01-12 04:40:26','2014-09-12 22:00:32'),

But in mid flight, our spaceship cabins became seperated and instead of landing in a field like Clark did, I crashed into an old abandoned mansion. I, unlike Clark, was already 15 then. I had been sent off the planet to help Clark become accustomed to the new planet, but I’d already failed that, so I scavenged the new planet for food and I made the mansion my home. After I’d gotten my bearings, I went into the local town to look for a job. I then found out I was in a country called America, a planet called Earth, and a city called Boston. I got a job for the newspaper, and I’ve spent my life honing my writing skills to become a better journalist. A few years after I joined the paper though, I found out about the weird power I had. And no, it wasn’t the same kind as Superman’s. You see, all Kryptonians share a basic set of powers but every Kryptonian has a unique single power that sets him or her away from everybody else. My power, oddly enough, was that whenever I was constipated, I turned into Lizard Man! As soon as I found out, I began practicing contipation excercises, so I could get constipated when I needed to turn into a lizard, and so I wouldn’t suddenly turn into a lizard in the middle of the street. I’ve been living my life like this for the past few years, but suddenly, a few months ago, everything changed. One night, I was sleeping in my bed at my mansion, when suddenly I woke up to find a vampire sucking my blood! Ever since then, I’ve had a strong yearning to suck blood, and the only way I can keep myself from giving into my vampiric temptations is to find an addiction so strong and overwhelming, I will be to busy to do anything else. That addiction now has a name. Ficlets.</p><p>MORE ABOUT ME<br>I would describe myself as a rocker gone D&D geek. I love writing, rocking, and everything in between.

Wow.</p><p>Let’s see; what is there to say about me?<br>I’ve been ficlet-ing since I was thirteen and would’ve died of happiness (then) and of embarrassment (now) if I had known of this place back then. Honestly, this site is such an amazing resource! People can read my work! And I’m not on an obscure Xanga account hoping for the best! This is fantastic!</p><p>(Note: I love that word. ‘Fantastic.)</p><p>I’m a girl, I hope you realize. I graduate from highschool this year. I originally started writing by roleplaying, but not in the way you think. Role-playing is, to me and all my friends who grew up in this style, a way of writing ficlets. Collaborating between one person or several people to create a story, in which you control only one character who, essentially, represents you. I mostly RP as males just because they fascinate me. (I live with just my mum. No male influence. I have a right to be fascinated.)<br>That being said, I swear I’m not too awful at portraying guys. I think I understand them more, in fact.</p><p>I’m a romantic. Typical, you say, but I think I’m more true to the word. Most think of ‘romantic’ as love and hearts and flowers and the like. I think of romanticism as an act and a mindset. I am more apt to write about a hero standing outside his dead mother’s ranch house in the pouring rain than I am about, say,...</p><p>mashed potatoes.</p><p><strong>Love Given Where Love Is Due</strong><br>To my first ever commenter: Bartimaeus<br>And to the runner-up: .:band baby:.</p><p>Both of whom are fantastic writers.

	(1812,'Thyme Passing','user_10961','<p>What is there to say about me? Well, actually quite a lot, comparatively. <br> To start, I am in the habit of answering my own questions. Is this a good or a bad thing? I can’t tell.<br> I love writing, which is probably pretty obvious. I have yet to finish any long stories, but I’ve finished a handful of short stories, and a multitude of poems.<br>My favorite food is…CHOCOLATE!!!! I cannot live without it. It is the pinnacle of perfection, epitome of excellence, the most audacious of ambrosias! But, as my mother says, all things in moderation! Sigh…Lindor truffles are the best. <br> I must have this gene or something that gives me strange ideas. For instance, I was one day hit by the revelation that my math teacher (both physically and in her demeanor) highly resembles an ill-tempered cow. Or that one day in art class when I was suddenly absorbed by the desire to write a list of alliterative phrases, such as “pinnacle of perfection”, or “the sordid story of the silver scalpel.” The people in my art class were highly amused. <br> I have a bad habit of correcting people’s grammar and spelling. It drives people insane. <br> Long obscure words are a lot of fun. You can view it as a collection, except unlike a lot of collections, I actually use mine. A collection of words is a lot more useful than a collection of stamps, no? No offense intended towards those who like collecting stamps, of course. <br> One last thing: I keep a journal. I have filled up 32 composition notebooks so far. I was fascinated when I found my great-great-great grandfather’s journals in my grandmother’s closet. These are my contribution to people in the future. I can only pray that they will be used for good, not for evil.

(This pen-name has a much lower dork-factor!)<br>.<br>I am, in order of importance, a father, a fiance, a son, and a brother. I do weather observations for a living, but my real dream is to become a published author.<br>.<br>18/03/08: I may be more prepared for National Novel Writer’s Month (NaNoWriMo) than I thought. The challenge with NaNoWriMo is to write a 50,000 word novel in 1 month. It works out to an average of 1,612 words a day. In about 10 hours (plus 2 more for Knight Rider breaks), I punched out 29 ficlets totalling 5,250 words.<br>.<br>Oh, yeah! Bring it on!<br>.<br>Damn… It’s only March…<br>.<br>13/03/08: I have now joined the ranks of the League of Awesomeness. Now, I must think of an appropriate title. How does Geekus Awesomeus sound? Yes, I like that. :D<br>.<br>Okay, I think there are enough people reading (and enjoying! WOO-HOO!) my stories that I should expand on this. Let you know a little more about me.<br>.<br>Um…<br>.<br>Well…<br>.<br>Gods, I hate talking about myself. How do you describe yourself without sounding either a) self-centered or b) overly critical? Ah, well. C’est la vie. :D<br>.<br>Well, let’s start with this: My sister taught me how to read when I was 3, and I was reading (and understanding) National Geographic by age 4. Is it any wonder she became a teacher? That got me interested in reading, but what got my hooked on writing stories was my introduction to role-playing games (ie Dungeons & Dragons – see http://ficlets.com/stories/23405 for more on that).<br>.<br>I was always writing in high school, but I never showed anyone my stories, outside of teachers, of course. And that was just because it was needed for grading. I enjoyed writing, but I never thought I was good enough for people to actually read what I wrote. And so, after high school, I stopped writing (other than character backgrounds for RPG’s) for almost 2 decades.<br>.<br>Then, two things happened. First, I had a bit of a breakdown one night. Stress. And I didn’t know where to direct it for relief. My fiancee, gods love her, suggested I start writing again. I told her I didn’t think I was good enough, and she (in not so many words) told me I was being an idiot.<br>.<br>The second thing that happened was stumbling across Wil Wheaton’s blog. I knew Wil (like 90% of the known universe) from Star Trek: TNG and Stand By Me, and I started reading his blog, which I’d heard was good. It’s beyond good. It’s fabulous! He’s smart, funny, and insightful, and just a damned good author. I got his audiobook Just A Geek and his book The Happiest Days Of Our Lives, and just something about these books really inspired me to get my writing back on track.<br>.<br>And it’s through Wil’s blog that I came across that font of awesomeness that is Ficlets. So, to make a long story short (not that this is exactly short), this is all your fault, Wheaton! Thank you. Thank you so much!<br>.<br>Anyhoo, if you want to know anything more about me, drop me a line.

I think he’s a genius.” <br>Dr. Jerry Falwell, Former Chancellor<br>Liberty University<br>Lynchberg, Va.</p><p>“Frank Harber is truly answering the questions that the secular mind is asking today. His crusades engage secular society with the compelling evidence of Christianity.” <br>Dr. Ken Hemphill, Former President<br>Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary<br>Fort Worth, Texas</p><p>“Frank Harber is an extremely gifted speaker. As a former atheist, Frank’s presentation is like few others I have ever heard.” <br>Brannon Howse<br>President<br>Christian Worldview Network</p><p>Praise for Frank Harber’s books<br>“Sherlock’s Faith is concise explanation of what Christianity is all about. It is straightforward and to the point. I urge you to buy multiple copies and give them to your friends you care about.” <br>Rick Warren<br>Pastor, Saddleback Valley Community Church<br>Mission Viejo, Calif.</p><p>“Dr. Frank Harber’s book is an excellent and practical tool to use in personal evangelism. It presents irrefutable evidences for the authenticity of the Biblical claims of Jesus Christ in a brief, readable, clear and non-technical style. Written for the non-Christian, it can be used effectively in witnessing as a bridge to reach both seekers and skeptics in our society with its increasing secularist-humanistic mindset.” <br>Dr. Darrell W. Robinson<br>Former Vice President, Evangelism<br>Home Mission Board, SBC<br>Alpharetta, Georgia</p><p>“In this well-reasoned and practical look at the essentials of the Gospel message, Evangelist Frank Harber has provided an excellent handbook for sharing one’s faith. Coming initially from an atheistic background, Harber is uniquely qualified to take us step by step into the life-changing message of Jesus Christ.” <br>Greg Laurie<br>Evangelist, Harvest Crusades<br>Pastor, Harvest Christian Fellowship<br>Riverside, Calif.</p>','2009-01-13 01:10:20','2014-09-12 22:00:33'),

Leon Walker, Jr. and Janie Mae Ward on July 9, 1964. He is the last of three children from this marriage.</p><p>Reginald or Reggie, as he prefers to be called, was educated in the all black school system of rural Perry County. Reggie tried to excel at all his studies in School. He held memberships in the National Junior and Senior Honor Societies. In 1981, he moved to Miami, Florida to live with his mother. After graduating from American Senior High School, he enlisted in the U. S. Army.</p><p>However, because of the call to preach and the tremendous preaching tradition in the Walker family, Reggie soon found himself preaching instead of fighting wars.</p><p>The first influence to preach came from his grandfather, Rev Walker, Sr. At the age of nine, Reggie accepted the call to preach at Greenleaf Baptist Church in Alabama.</p><p>After discharging from service in 1985, he studied under his father and other ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. He was licensed to preach at St, John A.M.E. Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma ordained an elder at Bethel A.M.E. Church in North Little Rock Arkansas and educated at Shorter Junior College in Arkansas.</p><p>Reggie’s first pastorate was at Derrick Chapel A.M.E. Church in Van Buren, Arkansas. Since then, he has pastured many churches in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, and Oklahoma, He now resides in Red Bird, Oklahoma and pastors Vision of Hope Church, Inc.</p><p>He works to encourage children of God everywhere to stand up and be the mighty men and women of God. His favorite saying is I am blessed just to be alive.</p><p>Reggie knows the importance of each day since he has been living with an incurable disease since 1987. However, he firmly believes, if he lives God get the glory and if he dies, God gets the blame. He gave his illness to God along time ago and refuses to worry about it anymore.</p><p>All intellectual property of this author has been copyrighted and all rights are reserved by Pastor Reginald Levi Walker.</p><p>(additional information about the meaning of Nabahood23)</p><p>Not Anger But Action will solve the problems of our nieghborHOODs.<br>23 stands for the 23rd Psalms.<br>P.S. 23 stands for ‘God loves you, therefore, I love you, too.’</p><p>Tags: Poem, Poetry, popular blog, blog, Reginald Levi Walker, Nabahood 23, Twenty-third Psalms Ministries, Tulsa Oklahoma, Marion Alabama, Miami Florida, American Senior High School Maimi Florida, preacher, pastor, African Methodist Episcopal Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, Rev.

I have brown hair and it’s quite short…just the way I like it. i’m responsible (another thing thats huge in my life) work ethics are big too you don’t get anywhere doing nothing all your life. I believe everything happens for a reason. The only kids I have are my two cats….I love the way a womans hand just fits so perfectly into mine, I love the way her lips, so soft, anticipating to kiss mine. I love the way a woman smells and feels and trembles when I touch her soft skin. Coffee gets me through my day—and thoughts of “Her” whose company I trade sleep for any time get me through the nights. I’m an insomniac <del>- It’s rare that I get a good night sleep, i can sometimes be very hard to understand -</del> and you should not try to understand me, I do not understand myself. I get bored really easily. So if you see me giggle or smirk to myself its just my head telling me something funny. i journal because the though of keeping everything bottled up inside me again is torture.I can be highly unpredictable…but thats just life…when i love you , you’ll know it, i’m going to tell you 850 times because thats just my nature. Never mistake my love for infatuation though, i don’t waist my time with unrealistic bullshit. I can be harsh at times, although i’m not hard, I try to act it sometimes but lets be honest…The smell of gasoline and rain (not together) are both bliss. Talking is so crucial to me and if we don’t have comunictaion you can pretty much consider just dying…lol. i’m very blunt and honest and random randomness turns me on so much. I stare at things for long periods of time, why not..I am very impulsive,I live for the moment…i’m a fucking sexahalic…lol i love it and every aspect of it…mastrbation is fun too expecially if someone is watching…I am an amazing writer. Poetry is my life I can sum things up with a few sweet words and sweep you off you feet…I can just randomly come up with something spur of the moment and it will be quite amazing. “I love my matchbook romance” My kisses dictate the secrets of her heart. “Yes I am a girl and you can still call me sir, cause I can’t cure this visual disease of yours… well I don’t give a damn about sir or mam so in the f or m boxes they give I forgive myself for not fitting in.” Alix Olsen</p>','2009-01-13 01:11:08','2014-09-12 22:00:35'),
