<h1>Welcome to the Ficlets archive!</h1>

<p>Ficlets is no more. AOL decided to kill the product, but thankfully, since all the content on the site was licensed under <%= link_to 'Creative Commons', 'http://creativecommons.org' %>, I decided that there's no reason to let the content die. So, consider this the Ficlets memorial. I will keep this site up as long as I'm able (it's extremely simple and not costing me anything).</p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity that AOL gave me to build and launch Ficlets with my friends. I'm disappointed that I couldn't get the site back after AOL decided to kill it off, but whatever. They're a big company with better things to do that deal with a lone developer, even one who gave them thirteen years and helped add over half a <em>billion</em> dollars to the bottom line over the years. If I sound bitter, I am, but only a little. I'm just glad the forty-five thousand (plus) stories that people wrote over the eighteen months that Ficlets was around will be around a while longer and may still become the source of some joy in the world.</p>
<p><%= link_to 'Jason Garber', 'http://sixtwothree.org' %> and I are working on a followup to Ficlets, that keeps the spirit of Ficlets, but will have no association with AOL.  We're building it in our free time, so it's going to take us a little while. Until it's ready to go, <%= link_to 'check it out and sign up for the launch mailing list', 'http://ficly.com' %>.</p>
<p>So, <%= link_to 'browse the archives and read some stories', stories_path %>.</p>
